								<dt>1. Precision Phenotyping of Complex, Heterogenous Conditions </dt>
								<dd>
									<p>
										The presence of heterogeneity in complex conditions indicates the potential for both differing underlying biology / disease etiologies as well as environmental effects. We aim to use machine learning methods to better characterize phenotypes in order to exploit this heterogeneity to better understand biology and/or environmental factors of disease. 
									</p>
								</dd>
								<dt>2. Safe and Effective Deployment of Machine Learning in the Clinic </dt>
								<dd>
									<p>The rapid advancement of AI tools in clinical care demands robust strategies in implementation sciences, effective deployment, enhanced physician-computer interaction, and thorough impact assessment. As the creation of cutting-edge models becomes more prevalent, there's a tendency to overvalue their positive effects without adequately weighing the potential drawbacks, such as physician burnout and shifts in health equity. Our group is committed to devising tactics to refine models for specific healthcare environments, ensuring their seamless integration into clinical routines, and meticulously gauging their efficacy. Without rigorous assessments, including strategies like randomization, we cannot be sure these tools are leading to better healthcare. We are developing methods to address these and related problems.</p>

								<dd>
									<p>Sahil Sethi, David Chen, Thomas Statchen, Michael C. Burkhart, Nipun Bhandari, Bashar Ramadan, Brett K Beaulieu-Jones. <i>Preprint</i> (2025) 
									<p>ProtoECGNet is a prototype-based deep learning model for multi-label ECG classification that mirrors clinical interpretation by learning distinct prototypes for rhythm, morphology, and global abnormalities. It introduces a contrastive loss to structure the prototype space based on diagnostic co-occurrence, achieving near state-of-the-art performance on PTB-XL while providing faithful, case-based explanations grounded in real ECG segments from the training set. ProtoECGNet delivers transparent reasoning across all 71 labels, spanning a comprehensive range of cardiac abnormalities in 12-lead ECGs.

										<br> *co-first authors</p>
									<p>
										Our team demonstrated that synthetic data distillation can fine-tune smaller, open-source large-language models (LLMs) to achieve performance similar to larger models in extracting clinical information. This smaller model outperforms its base version and sometimes even the larger model. This approach will enable more scalable and cost-efficient clinical information extraction, improving tasks like patient phenotyping. </p>

								<dd>
									<p>Rowan Hussein, Anna Zink, Bashar Ramadan, Frederick M Howard, Maia Hightower, Sachin Shah, Brett K Beaulieu-Jones. <i>Preprint</i> (2024) 
									<p>Our systematic analysis of healthcare AI governance frameworks revealed significant gaps in addressing diverse organizational needs, leading to the development of HAIRA - a novel, resource-aware maturity model spanning seven critical domains. This adaptive framework provides actionable governance pathways across five organizational levels, from small practices to major medical centers, enabling healthcare institutions to systematically assess and advance their AI governance capabilities based on available resources.

									<p>
										Our team compared Parkinson's disease (PD) progression across research and real-world populations, utilizing real-world data (RWD) and large language models for detailed characterization. It finds that patients in real-world settings are diagnosed later and start treatment later than those in research populations, with faster motor and cognitive progression in real-world cohorts. The study highlights the differences between research and real-world populations, emphasizing the need to use diverse data sources and account for biases in clinical trial design and analyses. </p>

									<p>
										Our team demonstrated machine learning models, particularly large language models pre-trained on domain-specific data, are highly effective in predicting seizure recurrence in children after an initial seizure-like event. These models outperformed traditional structured data approaches and indicate that clinical notes contain significant information useful for the prediction of seizure recurrence. </p>

										The biological mechanisms causing extreme symptoms in rare disease patients are complex and often elusive. This study analyzes genotype and phenotype data from the UK Biobank to understand the pathways leading to seizures in undiagnosed patients from the Undiagnosed Diseases Network. By examining milder, related symptoms in UK Biobank participants with similar genetic variants, the study aims to shed light on the molecular mechanisms behind these rare conditions

								<dd>
									<p>Lane Fitzsimmons, Francesca Frau, Sylvie Bozzi, Karen Chandross, Brett Beaulieu-Jones <i> Preprint </i> (2024)</p>
									<p>
										This study analyzed Parkinson's disease (PD) progression by examining clinical events across different Hoehn & Yahr (H&Y) stages extracted using natural language processing. It provides a view of healthcare utilization at different H&Y stages, models expected H&Y progression and demonstrates the potential value for a therapeutic which would slow progression.  </p>

									<p>Beaulieu-Jones, Brett K., William Yuan, Gabriel A. Brat, Andrew L. Beam, Griffin Weber, Marshall Ruffin, and Isaac S. Kohane.  <i>NPJ digital medicine</i> (2021)</p>
									<p>
										We trained deep learning models on clinician-initiated administrative data for 42.9 million admissions and found performance close to full EMR-based benchmarks for inpatient outcomes. These models rely heavily on clinical behavior, and should not be used for individualized clinical decision making. For meaningful clinical guidance, models should outperform these benchmarks using data sources that capture patient state rather than clinician actions (i.e., looking over their shoulder). </p>

									<p>
										The 21st Century Cures Act requires the US FDA to create guidelines for using real-world evidence (RWE) in the regulatory process. While RWE has led to crucial medical findings, it faces challenges in proving treatment efficacy compared to randomized controlled trials. In this review article, we summarized the advantages and limitations of RWE, identified the key opportunities for RWE, and pointed the way forward to maximize the potential of RWE for regulatory purposes.</p>
